## Introduction
Imagine your website converts 10% of its visitors to paying customers. Over the course of 1,000 visitors, how many converts should we expect? A quick back of the envelope calculation shows we should expect 100 conversions:
$$
1000 \, \text{visitors} * \frac{10 \, \text{conversions}}{100 \, \text{visitors}} = 100 \, \text{conversions}
$$


_But how much could that number vary each time we run this experiment?_

# Simulating Data
```{python}
#| echo: true

from numpy.random import binomial
from numpy import mean

conversion_rate = 0.10
number_of_visitors = int(1e3)


number_simulated_experiments = int(1e6)
control_simulated_results = binomial(
    number_of_visitors, conversion_rate, size=number_simulated_experiments
)


print(mean(control_simulated_results))
```
